This project implements an embedded robot vision system using OpenCV.
A camera captures real-time video frames which are converted from RGB to HSV color space.
Color thresholding is applied to detect specific objects based on color.
The system demonstrates how robots perceive and interpret their surroundings using vision sensors.
